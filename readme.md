# Blogging Platform RESTful API

## Objective
Create a RESTful API for managing blog posts and comments.

## Features
- **Endpoints:**
  - `GET /posts` - Retrieve all posts.
  - `POST /posts` - Create a new post.
  - `GET /posts/{id}` - Retrieve a specific post by ID.
  - `PUT /posts/{id}` - Update a specific post by ID.
  - `DELETE /posts/{id}` - Delete a specific post by ID.
  - `GET /posts/{id}/comments` - Retrieve all comments for a specific post.
  - `POST /posts/{id}/comments` - Add a comment to a specific post.

## Entities
- **Post**
  - `id` (Long)
  - `title` (String)
  - `content` (String)
  - `author` (String)
  - `createdDate` (LocalDateTime)
- **Comment**
  - `id` (Long)
  - `postId` (Long)
  - `content` (String)
  - `author` (String)
  - `createdDate` (LocalDateTime)

## Steps

### 1. Create Spring Boot Project
Initialize a new Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr (https://start.spring.io) with dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, and MySQL Driver.

### 2. Define Entities Post and Comment
Define the entities `Post` and `Comment` to represent the data structure of the application.

### 3. Create Repositories PostRepository and CommentRepository
Create `PostRepository` and `CommentRepository` interfaces to interact with the database.

### 4. Implement Service Layer PostService and CommentService
Implement service classes `PostService` and `CommentService` to handle business logic.

### 5. Create Controllers PostController and CommentController
Create `PostController` and `CommentController` to handle incoming HTTP requests and map them to the corresponding service methods.

### 6. Test the API
Use Postman or a similar tool to test the API endpoints.
- Verify that you can create, retrieve, update, and delete posts.
- Verify that you can add and retrieve comments for a specific post.

## Conclusion
By following these steps, you have created a RESTful API for managing blog posts and comments using Spring Boot. This API includes endpoints for CRUD operations on posts and for adding and retrieving comments related to posts.
